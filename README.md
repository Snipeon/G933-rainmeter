# G933-rainmeter

This is a skin to monitor the battery level of your Logitech G933 wireless headset. I have included the source code of the exe which grabs the battery value from LGS in case anyone wants to mess around with it to grab other values. For more info, please check out Wyse's repository about the G930 skin. It has the basic information to get you started.

1. Download and unzip G933.rar to your rainmeter folder.
2. Add autostart in the G933 folder to your startup programs list.
3. Load the skin on rainmeter.
4. Enjoy!
